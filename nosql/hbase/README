SAMPLE JAVA CODE TO USE APACHE HBASE
------------------------------------

!!! This project is not yet usable. Don't try to test it or you will be sorry...

This project contains JAVA code samples to interact with the Apache HBase (http://hbase.apache.org) solution.
It will show how to use the Client API and run some MAPREDUCE jobs against HBase.

You will need Java JDK 6.0 and Maven (http://maven.apache.org) correctly installed on your computer.

HOW TO
git clone git://github.com/echarles/t4f-hbase.git t4f-hbase
cd t4f-hadoop
mvn test
This will run the integration tests in the client and mapreduce modules.
